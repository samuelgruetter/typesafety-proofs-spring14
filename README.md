Explorations of type systems
----------------------------

This repo contains the relevant files that I produced
during my semester project on machine checked typesafety proofs in spring 2014.

Most of the work is related to the DOT (Dependent Object Types) Project,
see https://github.com/TiarkRompf/minidot and https://github.com/namin/dot for the code 
and http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf for the paper.
